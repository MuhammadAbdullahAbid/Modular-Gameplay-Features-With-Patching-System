 Modular Game Feature System

The **Modular Game Feature System** is a recent addition to Unreal Engine, enabling developers to create standalone features for their projects.

These standalone features serve to compartmentalize Unreal projects, maintaining a clean and readable codebase. The modular nature of game features helps prevent accidental dependencies, contributing to better project organization.

## Key Features

### Easily Injectable Content

- Seamlessly inject new content into an existing project.

### Non-Intrusive Core Game

- The core game remains entirely unaware of the modular game feature's existence.

### Dynamic Loading and Unloading

- Features are dynamically loadable and unloadable without disrupting the game.
